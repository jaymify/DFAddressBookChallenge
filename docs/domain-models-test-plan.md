### User Stories:
1) As an end user, I want to create an instance of the address book, so I can open it.
2)  As an end user, I want to add a new contacts name to the address book, so that I can view their details.
3) As an end user, I want to add a new contacts email to the address book, so that I can view their details.
4) As an end user, I want to add a new contacts phone number to the address book, so that I can view their details.
5) As an end user, I want an exception to throw if I haven't populated all 3 attributes (name, phone, email), so that my contact is complete.
6) As an end user, I want an option to view all contacts in the address book, so that I can get an overview.
7) As an end user, I want to search through my contacts by name, so that I can view their details.
8) As an end user, I want to search through my contacts by email address, so that I can view their details.
9) As an end user, I want to search through my contacts by phone number, so that I can view their details.
10) As an end user, I want an exception to throw if my search returns null, so I know my input is incorrect.
11) As an end user, I want to edit existing contact details, so that the information stays relevant.
12) As an end user, I want to remove an existing contact from the address book, so that I can no longer view their details.
13) As an end user, I want to be unable to add a duplicate email, so that my book remains organised.
14) As an end user, I want to be unable to add a duplicate phone number, so that my book remains organised.
15) As an end user, I want to have the new/edited email validated, so that the address book is uniform.
16) As an end user, I want to have the new/edited phone number validated, so that the address book is uniform.
17) As an end user, I want to use a console interface to interact with the address book, so I have more input.
